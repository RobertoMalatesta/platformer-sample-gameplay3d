### Usage
- Download and build [Gameplay3D](http://www.gameplay3d.org/) for your platform
- Clone this repository into the same directory as the 'GamePlay' directory:

```
├── GamePlay
└── platformer-sample-gameplay3d
```

- Run [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) and compile the generated project:

```
cd platformer-sample-gameplay3d
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

- Building the sample for android requires that you build Gameplay3D for android with the following in Application.mk:

```
APP_PLATFORM := android-10
APP_STL := gnustl_static
APP_ABI := armeabi-v7a
APP_CPPFLAGS += -frtti -std=gnu++11
NDK_TOOLCHAIN_VERSION := clang
APP_MODULES := libgameplay
```

- See 'game.config' for configuarable debug options and tools
- Use either a gamepad or the keyboard (directional arrows/WASD + space) to make the player move and jump
